# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project 

### How to
Run this script without any pre requisits (except running it in R) by sourcing the file:
`source("run_analysis.R")`
The script will create 2 files:
* first_tidy.txt : The mean and standard deviation tidy data set of each observation.
* second_tidy.txt : The average of the mean and standard deviation for each tuples (activity , subject).

### Introduction
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

This program contains the following steps :
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
1. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
1. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
1. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
1. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
